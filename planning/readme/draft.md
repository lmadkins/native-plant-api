## Why choose native plants?
Native plants have adapted to the sun, soil, and space where you are to plant them. They require less maintenance, and have co-evolved with animals and insects of the region.
Many are important food sources for local pollinators- bees, butterflies, beneficial insects, etc., which benefit your garden and yard, and biodiversity 


## Where is the Willamette Valley Ecoregion? (and what is an "ecoregion"?)
The ***Willamette Valley eco-region*** is nestled between the coastal range and the mountain range, and includes many major cities in Oregon and SW Washington, such as 
- the Portland, OR metro area
- the Vancouver, WA metro area
- Salem
- Eugene
- Corvallis 

A ***eco-region*** is an area where the climate, vegetation, geology, soils, and wildlife are similar.

## Disclaimer on Planting Information

**Do research before buying or planting.** 

Many native plants require  periods of cold stratification, ranging between 30-120 days, and some require cycles of warm stratification as well. Some also can take at least one year before blooming. Some plants are difficult to grow from seed and are best to just transplant. 

Plants requiring longer periods of stratification are best planted in Fall. Plants requiring shorter periods of stratification are best planted in Winter or late Winter/early Spring.

(You can also try to mimic stratification by storing the seeds in the refridgerator, and plant seeds in early Spring after the last frost-usually mid-March.)


## Disclaimer on Uses & Toxicity
Information about toxicity, edibility, and medicinal uses based on available information from sources below.

If information about its toxicity was not found, its toxicity is not listed.

A plant is listed "No" as toxic if information has clearly stated it is not toxic to humans, or if it is stated by multiple sources as edible. 
Plants listed "No" as toxic to humans may be toxic to pets, or be harmful in large quantities. These are listed under the plant's "Other Warnings"

> Do your own research and consult with professionals before ingesting plants, particularly for any medicinal uses.
