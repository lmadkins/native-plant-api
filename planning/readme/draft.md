## Why choose native plants?
Native plants have adapted to the sun, soil, and space where you are to plant them. They require less maintenance, and have co-evolved with animals and insects of the region.
Many are important food sources for local pollinators- bees, butterflies, beneficial insects, etc., which benefit your garden and yard, and biodiversity 


## Where is the Willamette Valley Ecoregion? (and what is an "ecoregion"?)
The ***Willamette Valley eco-region*** is nestled between the coastal range and the mountain range, and includes many major cities in Oregon and SW Washington, such as 
- the Portland, OR metro area
- the Vancouver, WA metro area
- Salem
- Eugene
- Corvallis 

A ***eco-region*** is an area where the climate, vegetation, geology, soils, and wildlife are similar.
