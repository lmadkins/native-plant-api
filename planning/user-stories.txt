I want capitalization to be standardized, and searches/results fetched to not be case-sensitive

I want the results to be filterable by query


Client-facing side:

Plant Identification: 
I want to be able to search the name of a plant (including scientific and common names) and get results
  - if it is a native plant (if not, to be told so)
  - information, photos about the plant

I want to be able to browse/filter plants by color, if I don't know the name

Landscaping/Gardening Planning:
I want to be able to find out native plants compatible with the light and other conditions in my garden, and to filter out toxicity, type, etc.

I want to have sources available for more information about where to get the plant
